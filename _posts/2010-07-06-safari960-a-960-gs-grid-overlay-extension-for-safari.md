title: Safari960 - A 960.gs grid overlay extension for Safari

I've used various grid bookmarklets in the past, but they always do a lot more than I need and I never like the defaults. Yesterday I finally decided to roll up my sleeves and scratch my itch by making a very simple [960.gs](http://960.gs) grid overlay extension for Safari.

It's available for download [here](/safari960) and the code is on [GitHub](http://github.com/henrrrik/Safari960). If you like it, help me improve it!

<strong>Update:</strong> Changed the download link to point to the [project page](/safari960).
