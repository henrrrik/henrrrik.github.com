I've finally decided to roll out version 1.0 of my [XStandard module for Drupal](http://drupal.org/project/xstandard).

So why choose XStandard over FCKeditor or TinyMCE?  Simply put, it produces valid markup. The pro version can actually filter material pasted from Word into semantic XHTML while retaining structure.
Here's a full [feature list](http://xstandard.com/en/documentation/xstandard-dev-guide/features/).

The blog [Standards Schmandards](http://www.standards-schmandards.com/) has an excellent [comparison of WYSIWYG editors](http://www.standards-schmandards.com/2007/wysiwyg-editor-test-2/).
