I just finished updating the [XStandard demo site](http://xstandard.sixshooter.se) for Drupal to version 6, making it my first live Drupal 6 site. The only modules I use on it are [XStandard](http://drupal.org/project/xstandard) (obviously), [Demonstration site (Sandbox)](http://drupal.org/project/demo) and [Google Analytics](http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics), so it was as straightforward as it gets.
It went pretty smoothly, despite my complete disregard for the upgrade instructions.
