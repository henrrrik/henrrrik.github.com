title: edit-On Pro WYSYWYG module for Drupal (Updated)
created: 1212999262
---
I've put together [a module](http://drupal.org/project/editonpro/) that integrates the [edit-on Pro WYSIWYG editor](http://www.realobjects.com/edit-on-Pro.435+M5d9bfab1bf7.0.html) with Drupal. edit-on Pro is a full-featured cross-platform (Java) editor that outputs clean accessible XHTML. Unfortunately it isn't free/open source. [Pricing](http://www.realobjects.com/Pricing.564+M5d9bfab1bf7.0.html) starts at â‚¬249 for a 10 seat license.

There is still a fair bit of work to do. For instance the module currently lacks support for image uploads.

<strong>Update:</strong> A permissions typo locked out everyone but user 1. I've also put up a [demo site](http://editonpro.sixshooter.se).
